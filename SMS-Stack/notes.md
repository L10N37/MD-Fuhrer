Probably better to use 16F627. Cheaper

or port across to 16F54, cheaper again. If a PCB is made
would likely use 16F54 SSOP (smaller footprint, not thru hole)

I dont see it being much that useful these days but
R type is a good SMS game and playing a legit copy without 
doing the 'swap' trick is nice


There are mistakes on the main.c, but it compiles, and it works. It was late, I was tired.
